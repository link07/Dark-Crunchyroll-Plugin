# Dark Crunchyroll Plugin
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tholinka/Dark-Crunchyroll-Plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tholinka/Dark-Crunchyroll-Plugin)

## Current Status

With the new [Crunchyroll beta site](https://beta.crunchyroll.com) being dark mode by default, this addon is likely to cease being useful.

As such, this repository will likely be archived once the beta experience is the default. Additionally, there likely will not be any updates. This may change if Crunchyroll reverts these dark mode friendly changes.

## About

This project is originally based off of the [Dark Youtube Plugin](https://github.com/stormbreakerbg/Dark-youtube-plugin-chrome), though a lot has been rewritten.

This plugin is currently available on the [Firefox Addon Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-skin-crunchyroll), the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-skin-for-crunchyroll/agjiicokbioponboibkfhfgmhcacafph), and the [Microsoft Edge Extension Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/dark-skin-for-crunchyroll/9nv1zg95rh2d).

This plugin aims to provide a quality dark theme for [Crunchyroll.com](https://crunchyroll.com).  This is primarily because dark themes are easier on the eye when in a darker environment.
It also leaves a button in the addon bar to quickly disable and re-enable the theme.

If there are any unthemed pages, or other issues such as weird color choices, please report them!

See [Releases](https://github.com/tholinka/Dark-Crunchyroll-Plugin/releases) for changelog.

## Build

### Setup

1. Install latest stable `yarn` and `gulp-cli` globally (either through your package manager, or through npm, etc)
2. run `yarn install`
3. Run `gulp` for automatic build-on-change and css lint
   1. by default `gulp watchCrhome` is run, see `gulp --tasks` to view all available
4. Load the plugin in Chrome/Firefox from the `build` directory

### #CSS processing

The CSS files use SCSS and must be named `src/styles/<component-or-page>.css.scss`.
Any mixins reside in `src/styles/_mixins.scss` and the variables are in `src/styles/_variables.scss`.

**Do not add color literals (hex or rgba) in any file except `_variables.scss`.**
If possible, use the already existing colors there and "remix" them with functions such as
`rgba($color, 0.4)`, `lighten($color, 30%)` and `darken($color, 20%)`.

At the start of each new scss file put `@import 'common';`, which imports the variables and the mixins.
